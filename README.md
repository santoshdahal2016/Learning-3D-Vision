# Learning 3D Vision (geometric approach to computer vision)

It is the field of computer vision which deals with the reconstruction of original component of scene from the 2d images.


## Prerequisite

1. Linear Algebra


## What is image ?

In 3d vision , we define image as the projection of real world into the plane .  We will first study how these projection occurs and how images are formed .

There are 3 type of projection :

1. Perspective Projection
2. Orthographic Projection
3. Weak Perspective Projection

We will only consider **Perspective projection** mostly while studying 3d Vision .
